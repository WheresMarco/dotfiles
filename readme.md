    $ git pull origin master
    $ ~/Scripts/install.sh

## Stuff To Change

**Please change the `.gitconfig` so you don't commit everything as me.** You'll also need to remove the `signingkey` option under my email and the `commit` section at the bottom of that file. Everything else shouldn't need tweaking.

Enjoy.
